        "Here’s what Air India’s guidelines for liquor service states:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Flyers should be served liquor at their seats only. Consumption of liquor brought by a passenger should be discouraged.\n" +
        "Only one drink should be served at a time, with one drink being defined as a 12-ounce beer, a full glass of wine or champagne, or one miniature bottle of liquor.\n" +
        "No alcohol should be served to those under 18 years of age.\n" +
        "On flights with a duration of less than four hours, no more than two drinks should be served to the passenger.\n" +
        "There must be a break of at least three hours before serving additional drinks once three drinks are served to the passenger. Notably, the airline policy mentions that these restrictions may not apply to passengers travelling in business class.\n" +
        "Cabin crew are advised to stop the service of liquor to intoxicated passengers.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The above liquor policy has come under scanner in the aftermath of a drunk man peeing on a co-passenger. The airline officials have said that Air India doesn't serve unlimited alcohol to passengers on long-haul flights. There is a quota, which is determined by the passenger's class of travel."
